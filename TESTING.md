The aspects considered while testing:
- CRUD functionality for Posts, Comments, Likes, Follows and Profile on both the development and deployed version of the site.

## Validation

### W3C Validator 

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website. No errors were identified. 
Result is as shown here.
![HTML Validation](documentation/validation/html-validation.png)

### W3C Jigsaw Validator 

The official W3C Markup Validator was used to validate the CSS in the project.

[W3C CSS Jigsaw Validatior](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

All CSS code passed through the validator without any issues.

### JSX Validation using ESLint

- ESlint was downloaded following the instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/ianmeigh/8e603b91a38d7829d959402bfcf29d3d), credit goes to Ian Meigh. 
![JSX Validation](documentation/validation/eslint-validation.png)

1. Error: Do not pass children as props compile error for Infinite Scroll component: This was solved by removing children element and place code in tags. Detailed screenshot in Issue and Fix section in README.md.

2. Error in DropdownMenu.js - component-definition-is-missing-display-name 
	- Credit: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-component-definition-missing-display-name-react-display-name-error-occur-JavaScript-HTML-arrays-reactjs-antd-development)
	- Reason: ESLint thinks you are defining a new component without setting any name to it.

	This is explained because ESLint cannot recognise the render prop pattern because you are not directly writing this render prop into a component, but into an object.

	You can either put the render prop directly into your jsx implementation of the component, or shut down the ESLint's error by doing this :

	// eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name

	OR

	If anyone needs to avoid this in all the files, add below to the rules section of .eslintrc.js file,

	{ 
	... 
	"rules": { 
		"react/display-name": "off" 
	} 
	} 

I used last one. Add "react/display-name": "off" in .eslintrc.json file.
